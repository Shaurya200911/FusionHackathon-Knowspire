- **Services Layer**: Handles Gemini AI integration, XP logic, streaks, and skill completion.
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Uses Google Gemini API for lesson, flashcard, and quiz generation. Prompts are dynamically constructed based on user history and session mode.
- **Session Management**: Each skill session is tracked, with options for revision or continuation. Previous content is cached for context-aware AI responses.

### Frontend

- **Gamification Elements**: Badges, leaderboards, and achievement highlights.

### AI & Data
- **Google Gemini API**: Generates lessons, flashcards, quizzes, and answers to doubts in real time.
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: AI sees what was taught last time and chooses the best next topic for the allotted time slot.
- **Caching**: Lessons, flashcards, and quizzes are cached per user/skill for fast retrieval and continuity.

### Security & DevOps
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive keys (Gemini API) stored in `.env` and ignored by git.
- **User Authentication**: Django's built-in auth system for secure login/register/logout.
